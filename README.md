# D2M2N
This repository contains the source code for the paper titled [D2M2N: Decentralized Differentiable Memory-Enabled Mapping and Navigation for Multiple Robots](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07070.pdf). Full code will be released after completion of project. 

Recently, a number of learning-based models have been proposed for multi-robot navigation. However, these models lack memory and only rely on the current observations of the robot to plan their actions. They are unable to leverage past observations to plan better paths, especially in complex environments. In this work, we propose a fully differentiable and decentralized memory-enabled architecture for multi-robot navigation and mapping called _D2M2N_. _D2M2N_ maintains a compact representation of the environment to remember past observations and uses Value Iteration Network for complex navigation. We conduct extensive experiments to show that _D2M2N_ significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art model in complex mapping and navigation task.
